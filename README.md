## 🔍 Abstract

This project presents an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**-based droop control strategy for voltage stability optimization in microgrids. Unlike conventional droop control, which uses static coefficients, this adaptive system leverages ANN to tune droop coefficients dynamically based on real-time power changes. The methodology combines:
- **State-Space Modeling**
- **PI Control & Virtual Inertia**
- **Adaptive Droop Coefficients**
- **ANN-based forecasting for voltage (V) and frequency (F)**

Implemented in **Python**, the model achieves superior voltage and frequency regulation under varying load conditions.

## 🛠 Methodology Overview

### 🔄 Droop Control Equations
```math
V = 230 - (mp + kp * (P - 1000)) * (P - 1000)

F = 50  - (nq + kq * (Q - 500)) * (Q - 500)
```
